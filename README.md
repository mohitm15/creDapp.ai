# creDapp.ai
Decentralized AI-powered Banking-CRA solution

## Introduction

Cre√êApp.ai is an **AI-driven autonomous credit rating agency** that attempts to crowdsource its process by decentralizing it. The CRA market is mostly *dominated* and the should-be-public data is actually private and consumed for analytics. This subtly puts the credit rating process in the hands of Artifical Intelligence, afterall it's statistical measures that help estimate the lending risks. However, its essential that the machine learning model keeps learning keeping the analytics data **public as well as encrypted**. To achieve this, we use *Ethereum* as the decentralization network which uses a server ONLY for computation. It must be noted that the pravalent model is also stored on *IPFS* and isn't localized.

## Get started
